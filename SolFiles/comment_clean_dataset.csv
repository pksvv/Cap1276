UghNdyIm1uXDVngCoAEC,zWg7U0OEAoE,0,Which  book  should  we  refer  along  with  these  lectures      Can  anyone  suggest      
UgixAmQeyEFsUHgCoAEC,zWg7U0OEAoE,0,wow  good  explanation  but  i  have  this  Q  one  of  my  boy  ask  me  the          How  i  can  Write  a  program  that  integers  1  to  20  to  a  binary  search  tree    Assume  the  root  node  is  created  with              value  10            Assume  the  data  structure    StructNode    Int  value    Node  next                                      Node    head  NULL      Assume  also  that  there  is  a  value  10  in  the  linked  list  Write  a  code  that  deletes  a  node  with  this  value  Consider  all  the  following  cases    a  	The  node  is  at  the  head  b  	The  node  is  at  the  middle  c  	The  node  is  at  the  end  Show  less
UgjGUFMwLUrMGngCoAEC,zWg7U0OEAoE,0,not  complete  algorithms    np  not  explained  
UghNyU8c8G_v73gCoAEC,zWg7U0OEAoE,1,Very  well  explained    better  than  my  lecturer    though  increase  the  slide  focusing  I  had  to  strain  so  that  I  could  read  
UgguKMOE3L54QXgCoAEC,zWg7U0OEAoE,11,Tank  you      really  a  good  and  understandable  lecture

Ugj6Tc--bD0-oHgCoAEC,zWg7U0OEAoE,0,Awesome  lectures  Thanks  for  these  videos
UgiQwUIwFP192ngCoAEC,zWg7U0OEAoE,4,Starting  at  about  36  00  minutes    the  lecturer  states              any  constant  time  g  n    will  just  be  a  displacement  of  g  n                  which  is  not  correct          
UgiusMexMaxXLHgCoAEC,zWg7U0OEAoE,27,Now  i  understand  what  is  the  Big  O  Notation      Thanks  Naveen      i  saw  MIT  lectures  on  this  as  well  but  u  only  made  it  clear          
Ugg56iJPzT_q2HgCoAEC,zWg7U0OEAoE,0,good  one  thanks  a  ton        
Ughn0GD83kd6TXgCoAEC,zWg7U0OEAoE,7,you  are  an  idiot          people  like  you  are  a  curse  in  programming  world  
Ughxh-k88RI2RXgCoAEC,zWg7U0OEAoE,0,what  text  is  recommended  to  use  with  these  lectures  also  with  design  and  analysis  of  algorithms  thanks  
UgjUfwKQwz9EgngCoAEC,zWg7U0OEAoE,1,26  02    a  slight  mistake  here  is  in  the  suggested  best  case  running  time    The  summation  of  j  2  to  n  over  t  sub  j    multiplied  with  some  constants    grows    quadratically    with  n    even  if  t  sub  j  is  always  equal  to  1    One  way  to  verify  this  is  using  Gauss'  sum  formula    if  t  sub  j  is  1    we  can  simply  leave  it  out    and  treat  the  summation  as  an  arithmetic  progression  of  number  up  until  n    This  means  Gauss'  sum  formula  is  in  fact  applicable    which  means  we  can  replace  the  summation  with  n  n  1    2        1  2  n  2        1  2  n      f  n  2      Another  way  to  think  about  this    assuming  we  wouldn't  know  about  this  simple  formula    is  to  look  at  the  growth    what  if  n  would  become  n  1    For  the  evidently  linear  component  of  our  equation      n        c1      c2                this  would  become  n    c1      c2        c1      c2    This  also  shows  us  that  differential  equations  lose  a  power  in  every  term    just  an  interesting  fact  as  to  how  you  could  know  the  increase  of  something  linear  will  be  constant    and  the  increase  of  something  constant  is  0    if  you  take  knowledge  on  differential  equations  as  a  prerequisite      Now  the  increase  in  the  term  including  the  summation  would  be    n  1  t  j  c4      c5      c6      besides  the  other  part  of  the  summation  which  I  can't  represent  properly  without  LaTeX    This  means  we  have  found  another  way  to  confirm  our  summation  grows  quadratically    as  our  input  size  increases  linearly    not  by  1    hence  requiring  a  power  to  be  added    Yet  another  way  to  confirm  why  differential  equations  lose  a  power  in  every  term      Great  lecture    thanks  for  sharing  this  on  the  internet  for  free  
UgjH3ZWWqPy5N3gCoAEC,zWg7U0OEAoE,0,its  very  nice  and    informative    those  who  have  introducing  computing  world
