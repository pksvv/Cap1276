Asymptotic Notation :
1. Big O - (upperbound) f<=g then f(n)=O(g(n))
2. Big Omega - (Lower bound ) f>=g then f(n)=Œ©(g(n)).
3. Big Theta - (tight Bounds) ( f<=a*g and f>=b*g ) or f=g then f(n)=Œò(g(n)).
4. Little O - (Strictly upper) f<g then f(n)=o(g(n)).

UgjUfwKQwz9EgngCoAEC,zWg7U0OEAoE,"26:02, a slight mistake here is in the suggested best case running time. The summation of j=2 to n over t sub j (multiplied with some constants) grows *quadratically* with n, even if t sub j is always equal to 1. One way to verify this is using Gauss' sum formula: if t sub j is 1, we can simply leave it out, and treat the summation as an arithmetic progression of number up until n. This means Gauss' sum formula is in fact applicable, which means we can replace the summation with n(n+1)/2 = (1/2)n^2 + (1/2)n = f(n^2). Another way to think about this, assuming we wouldn't know about this simple formula, is to look at the growth: what if n would become n+1? For the evidently linear component of our equation ( n * (c1 + c2 +...), this would become n*(c1 + c2) + c1 + c2. This also shows us that differential equations lose a power in every term (just an interesting fact as to how you could know the increase of something linear will be constant, and the increase of something constant is 0, if you take knowledge on differential equations as a prerequisite). Now the increase in the term including the summation would be (n+1)t_j(c4 + c5 + c6), besides the other part of the summation which I can't represent properly without LaTeX. This means we have found another way to confirm our summation grows quadratically, as our input size increases linearly, not by 1, hence requiring a power to be added. Yet another way to confirm why differential equations lose a power in every term.
